This is a program that uses the hand tracking module to build an AI virtual mouse. Here's how to use it:

1. Touching the thumb to the index finger is a click.

2. Spreading the thumb and middle finger apart moves the cursor upward.\

3. Touching the thumb and middle finger together moves the cursor downward.

4. Touching the middle finger and index finger together moves the mouse cursor.

That's all
